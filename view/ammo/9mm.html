        <h1>9mm</h1>
        <p>
          The 9×19mm Parabellum is a firearms cartridge that was designed by Georg Luger and introduced in 1902 by the German weapons
          manufacturer Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken (DWM) (German Weapons and Munitions Factory) for their Luger semi-automatic
          pistol. For this reason, it is designated as the 9mm Luger by the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute (SAAMI),
           and the 9 mm Luger by the Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives (CIP).
        </p>
        <p>
          Under STANAG 4090, it is a standard cartridge for NATO forces as well as many non-NATO countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          The name Parabellum is derived from the Latin: Si vis pacem, para bellum ("If you seek peace, prepare for war"), which was the motto of DWM.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the 2014 edition of Cartridges of the World, the 9×19mm Parabellum is "the world's most popular and widely used military handgun and submachinegun cartridge."
          The popularity of this cartridge can be attributed to the widely held conviction that it is effective in police and self-defense use.
           Its low cost and wide availability contribute to the caliber's continuing popularity.
        </p>
        <h2>Origins</h2>
        <p>
          Georg Luger developed the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge from his earlier 7.65×21mm Parabellum round, which itself was derived from the original
          7.65×25mm Borchardt cartridge in the Borchardt C-93 pistol. Shortening the length of the cartridge case used in the Borchardt pistol allowed him
           to improve the design of the toggle lock and to incorporate a smaller, angled grip. Luger's work on the Borchardt design evolved into the Luger
           pistol, first patented in 1898 and chambered in 7.65×21mm Parabellum. Demand from Germany for a larger caliber in their military sidearm led Luger
            to develop the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge for the eventual P08 pistol. This was achieved by removing the bottleneck shape of the 7.65×21mm
            Parabellum case, resulting in a tapered rimless cartridge encasing a bullet that was 9 mm in diameter.
        </p>
        <h2>Popularity</h2>
        <p>
          After World War I, acceptance of the 9×19mm Parabellum chambering increased, and 9×19mm Parabellum pistols and submachine guns were
          adopted by military and police users in many countries. The 9×19mm Parabellum has become the most popular caliber for U.S. law
          enforcement agencies, primarily due to the availability of compact pistols with large magazine capacities that use the cartridge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Worldwide, the 9×19mm Parabellum is one of the most popular pistol cartridges where it is legal (some countries ban civilian
          use of weapons that chamber current or former military service cartridges), and cartridges in this caliber are generally available anywhere pistol ammunition is sold.
