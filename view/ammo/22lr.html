        <h1>.22 Long Rifle</h1>
        <p>
          The .22 Long Rifle (metric designation: 5.6×15mmR) cartridge is a long-established variety of .22 caliber rimfire ammunition,
          and in terms of units sold is still by far the most common ammunition in the world today.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cartridge is often referred to simply as .22 LR and various rifles, pistols, revolvers,
           submachine guns and even some smoothbore shotguns (No. 1 bore) have been manufactured in this caliber.
        </p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          American firearms manufacturer J. Stevens Arms & Tool Company introduced the cartridge in 1887 by combining the casing of
           the .22 Long with the 40-grain (2.6 g) bullet of the .22 Extra Long. The round owes its origin to the Flobert BB cap of 1845
            through the .22 Smith & Wesson cartridge of 1857. It is one of the few cartridges that are accepted by a large variety of
            rifles, as well as pistols. The .22 Long Rifle and related cartridges (.22 Short, .22 Long, and .22 Extra Long) use a heeled
             bullet, which means that the bullet is the same diameter as the case, and has a narrower "heel" portion that fits in the case.
        </p>
        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p>
          Today, rimfire rounds are mainly used for hunting small pests, for sports shooting, for plinking, and for inexpensive training.
           The .22 LR is the choice for several shooting events: biathlon, bullseye, plus divisions of benchrest shooting, metallic silhouette
           and pin shooting, most high school, collegiate, Boy Scouts of America, Project Appleseed, 4H shooting events, and many others. It is
           also used in the precision Rifle and Pistol shooting events at the Olympic Games. Good quality rimfire ammunition can be quite accurate.
            The main advantages are low cost, low recoil, low noise and high accuracy-to-cost ratio. The main disadvantage is its low power; it is
            better suited for use on small game and other small animals.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a defensive cartridge, it is considered inadequate, though the small size allows very lightweight, easily concealable handguns which
           can be carried in circumstances where anything larger would be impractical. Despite their limitations, people can use .22 LR pistols and
            rifles for defense, and are common simply because they are prevalent, inexpensive, and widely available.
