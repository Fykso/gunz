        <h1>7.62x39mm</h1>
        <p>
          The 7.62×39mm (aka 7.62 Soviet) round is a rimless bottlenecked intermediate cartridge of Soviet origin that was
          designed during World War II. Due to the worldwide proliferation of RPD and RPK light machine guns and SKS and AK-47
          pattern rifles, the cartridge is used by both militaries and civilians alike. 7.62×39mm ammunition is purportedly tested
          to function well in temperatures ranging from −50 to 50 °C (−58 to 122 °F) cementing its usefulness in cold polar or hot desert conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is commonly believed that the 7.62×39mm cartridge was influenced by a variety of foreign developments, including the German STG-44, though this has been debated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shortly after World War II, the world's most widespread military-pattern rifle was designed for this cartridge: the AK-47.
          The cartridge remained the Soviet standard until the 1970s. It was largely replaced in Russian service by the 5.45×39mm cartridge,
          which is used by the current-issue AK-74M service rifle and its variants. In the 21st century the 7.62×39mm remains a common service
          rifle chambering, including for newly developed rifles.
        </p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          On July 15, 1943, the Technical Council of the People's Commissariat for Armaments (Russian: Техсовет Наркомата Вооружения) met to discuss
          the introduction of a Soviet intermediate cartridge. The Soviet planners also decided at this meeting that their new cartridge be used in a
          whole range of infantry weapons, including a semi-automatic carbine, a selective fire rifle, and a light machine gun. The job of designing
          the Soviet intermediate cartridge was assigned to a committee led by chief designer NM Elizarov (Н.М. Елизаров), assisted by PV Ryazanov
          (П.В. Рязанов), BV Semin (Б.В. Семин) and IT Melnikov (И.Т. Мельников). Elizarov collaborated closely with some leading weapons designers,
          including Fedorov, Tokarev, Simonov, and Shpagin. About 314 cartridge designs were considered theoretically, before narrowing the selection
          down to 8 models that were physically constructed and tested.
        </p>
        <p>
          A first variant of the new cartridge was officially adopted for service after completing range trials in December 1943; it was given 
          the GRAU index 57-N-231. This cartridge actually had a case length of 41 mm, so it is sometimes referred to as the 7.62×41. The bullet
          it contained was 22.8 mm long and had a core made entirely of lead. This bullet has a somewhat stubbier appearance than later 7.62×39
          bullets, with its maximal radius being attained after only 13.01 mm from its tip, and it was lacking a boat tail. After some further
          refinements, a pilot production series of this cartridge began in March 1944.
