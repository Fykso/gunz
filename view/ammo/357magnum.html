        <h1>.357 Magnum</h1>
        <p>
          The .357 S&W Magnum (9Ã—33mmR), or simply .357 Magnum, is a revolver cartridge with a .357-inch (9.07 mm) bullet diameter.
          It was created by Elmer Keith, Phillip B. Sharpe, and D. B. Wesson of firearms manufacturers Smith & Wesson and Winchester.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is based upon Smith & Wesson's earlier .38 Special cartridge. The .357 Magnum cartridge was introduced in 1934,
          and its use has since become widespread. This cartridge started the "Magnum era" of handgun ammunition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The .357 Magnum cartridge is notable for its highly effective terminal ballistics when used for hunting or defense.
        </p>
        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>
          The .357 Magnum was collaboratively developed over a period in the early to mid-1930s by a group of individuals in a
          direct response to Colt's .38 Super Automatic. At the time, the .38 Super was the only American pistol cartridge capable
          of defeating automobile cover and the early ballistic vests that were just beginning to emerge in the post-World War I "Gangster Era."
          Tests at the time revealed that those vests defeated any handgun bullet traveling less than about 1,000 feet per second (300 m/s).
          Colt's .38 Super Automatic just edged over that velocity and was able to penetrate car doors and vests that bootleggers and gangsters were employing as cover.
        </p>
        <h2>Performance</h2>
        <p>
          This cartridge is regarded by many as an excellent hunting, metallic silhouette and self-defense round. With proper loadings it
          can also be effective against large or dangerous game, such as bear and ungulates, however many consider the larger magnum calibers
          to be more appropriate such as the .500 Smith & Wesson, .50 Action Express, .44 Magnum, .454 Casull, .41 Magnum as well as other larger magnum rounds.
