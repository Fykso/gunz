        <h1>.38 Special</h1>
        <p>
          The .38 Smith & Wesson Special (commonly .38 Special, .38 Spl, or .38 Spc, pronounced "thirty-eight special") is a rimmed,
          centerfire cartridge designed by Smith & Wesson. It is most commonly used in revolvers, although some semi-automatic pistols
          and carbines also use this round. The .38 Special was the standard service cartridge of most police departments in the United
          States from the 1920s to the early 1990s, and was also a common sidearm cartridge used by soldiers in World War I. In other
          parts of the world, it is known by its metric designation of 9×29.5mmR or 9.1×29mmR.
        </p>
        <p>
          Known for its accuracy and manageable recoil, the .38 Special remains the most popular revolver cartridge in the world more
          than a century after its introduction. It is used for target shooting, formal target competition, personal defense, and for hunting small game.
        </p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          The .38 Special was designed in 1898 to be a higher velocity round, with better penetration properties than the
          .38 Long Colt that was in Government Service in the Philippines during the Spanish–American War. The .38 Long Colt
          revolver round wouldn't penetrate the insurgent Philippine Morro warrior shields, and the Government contracted the
          new revolver round to Smith & Wesson. The .38 Special held a minimum of 21 grains of black powder, which was 3 grains
          more than the current .38 Long Colt, and it was 100 to 150 feet per second faster with a 158 grain bullet.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the late 1920s, and in response to demands for a more effective law enforcement version of the cartridge, a
          new standard-velocity loading for the .38 Special was developed by Western Cartridge Company. This .38 Special variant
          incorporated a 200 grains (13 g) round-nosed lead 'Lubaloy' bullet, the .38 Super Police. Remington-Peters also
          introduced a similar loading. Testing revealed that the longer, heavier 200 grains (13 g) .357-calibre bullet fired
          at low velocity tended to 'keyhole' or tumble upon impact, providing more shock effect against unprotected personnel.
          At the same time, authorities in Great Britain, who had decided to adopt the .38 caliber revolver as a replacement for
          their existing .455 service cartridge, also tested the same 200 grains (13.0 g) bullet in the smaller .38 S&W cartridge.
          This cartridge was called the .38 S&W Super Police or the .38/200. Britain would later adopt the .38/200 as its standard
          military handgun cartridge.
        </p>
        <h2>Performance</h2>
        <p>
          Due to its black powder heritage, the .38 Special is a low pressure cartridge, one of the lowest in common use today at 17,000
          PSI. By modern standards, the .38 Special fires a medium-sized bullet at rather low speeds. In the case of target loads, a 148
          gr (9.6 g) bullet is propelled to only 690 ft/s (210 m/s). The closest comparisons are the .380 ACP, which fires much lighter
          bullets slightly faster than most .38 Special loads; the 9×19mm Parabellum, which fires a somewhat lighter bullet significantly
          faster; and the .38 Colt Super, which fires a comparable bullet significantly faster. All three of these are usually found in semi-automatic pistols.
