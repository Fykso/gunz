        <h1>.50 BMG</h1>
        <p>
          The .50 Browning Machine Gun (.50 BMG, 12.7×99mm NATO and designated as the 50 Browning by the C.I.P.[1]) is a cartridge developed for
          the Browning .50 caliber machine gun in the late 1910s. Entering service officially in 1921, the round is based on a greatly scaled-up
          .30-06 cartridge. Under STANAG 4383, it is a standard cartridge for NATO forces as well as many non-NATO countries. The cartridge itself
          has been made in many variants: multiple generations of regular ball, tracer, armor-piercing (AP), incendiary, and saboted sub-caliber
          rounds. The rounds intended for machine guns are linked using metallic links.
        </p>
        <p>
          The .50 BMG cartridge is also used in long-range target and anti-materiel rifles, as well as other .50-caliber machine guns.
        </p>
        <p>
          A wide variety of ammunition is available, and the availability of match grade ammunition has increased the usefulness of .50
          caliber rifles by allowing more accurate fire than lower quality rounds.
        </p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          John Browning had the idea for this round during World War I in response to a need for an anti-aircraft weapon, based on a scaled-up
          .30-06 Springfield design, used in a machine gun based on a scaled-up M1919/M1917 design that Browning had initially developed around
          1900 (but which was not adopted by the U.S. military until 1917, hence the model designation). Armor-piercing incendiary tracer
          (APIT) rounds were especially effective against aircraft, and the AP rounds and armor-piercing incendiary (API) rounds were excellent
          for destroying concrete bunkers, structures, and lighter armored fighting vehicles (AFVs). The API and APIT rounds left a flash, report,
          and smoke on contact, useful in detecting strikes on enemy targets.
        </p>
        <h2>Typical uses</h2>
        <p>
          The primary military use of this round is in the Browning M2HB heavy machine gun.
        </p>
        <p>
          The U.S. Coast Guard uses .50 BMG rifles to disable outboard engines from armed helicopters during interdictions.
          Similarly, .50 BMG weapons have attracted attention from law enforcement agencies; they have been adopted by the New York
          City Police Department as well as the Pittsburgh Police. A .50 BMG round can effectively disable a vehicle when fired into
          the engine block. If it is necessary to breach barriers, a .50 BMG round will penetrate most commercial brick walls and concrete cinder blocks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The .50 BMG round has been used as a sniper round as early as the Korean War. The former record for a confirmed long-distance kill was set 
          by U.S. Marine sniper Carlos Hathcock in 1967, at a distance of 2,090 meters (2,290 yd; 1.30 mi); Hathcock used the .50 BMG in an M2 Browning
          Machine Gun equipped with a telescopic sight. This weapon was used by other snipers, and eventually purpose-built sniper rifles were developed
          specifically for this round.
