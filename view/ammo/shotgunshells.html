        <h1>Shotgun shell</h1>
        <p>
          A shotgun shell is a self-contained cartridge typically loaded with multiple metallic "shot", which are small, generally
          spherical projectiles. The shells consist of a case mounted on a brass base holding a primer. The shot is typically contained
          in a small container inside the shell casing.[1] Shot has traditionally been made of lead, but steel, tungsten or bismuth is
          frequently used due to restrictions on lead.[2] A shotgun shell can contain a single, large projectile known as a shotgun slug.
          They can also be made with specialty non-lethal rounds such as beanbag rounds, and rubber. An old non-lethal round consisted
          of a shotgun shell loaded with rock salt, which could inflict very painful, but rarely deadly, wounds, and was popular for scaring away trespassers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most shotgun shells are designed to be fired from a smoothbore barrel, but dedicated shotguns with rifled barrels are limited to sabot slugs.
          A rifled barrel will increase the accuracy of sabot slugs, but makes it unsuitable for firing shot, as it imparts a spin to the shot cup,
          causing the shot cluster to disperse. A rifled slug uses rifling on the slug itself so it can be used in a smoothbore shotgun.
        </p>
        <h2>Sizes</h2>
        <p>
          Shotgun shells are generally measured by "gauge", which is the weight, in fractions of a pound, of a pure lead round ball that is
          the same diameter as the internal diameter of the barrel; in Britain and some other locations outside the United States the term
          "bore" is used with the same meaning.[4] This contrasts with rifles and handguns, which are almost always measured in "caliber",
          a measurement of the internal diameter of the barrel measured in millimeters or inches and, consequently, is approximately equal
          to the diameter of the projectile that is fired.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, a shotgun is called "12-gauge" because a lead sphere that just fits the inside diameter of the barrel weighs ​1⁄12 of a pound.
          This measurement comes from the time when early cannons were designated in a similar manner—a "12 pounder" would be a cannon that fired a
          12-pound (5.5 kg) cannonball; inversely, an individual "12-gauge" shot would in fact be a ​1⁄12 pounder (38 g). Thus, a 10-gauge shotgun has
          a larger-diameter barrel than a 12-gauge shotgun, which has a larger-diameter barrel than a 20-gauge shotgun, and so forth.
        </p>
