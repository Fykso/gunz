      <h1>Shotgun</h1>
      <p>
        A shotgun (also known as a scattergun, or historically as a fowling piece) is a firearm that is usually designed to be fired from the shoulder,
        which uses the energy of a fixed shell to fire a number of small spherical pellets called shot, or a solid projectile called a slug. Shotguns come
        in a wide variety of sizes, ranging from 5.5 mm (.22 inch) bore up to 5 cm (2.0 in) bore, and in a range of firearm operating mechanisms, including
        breech loading, single-barreled, double or combination gun, pump-action, bolt-, and lever-action, semi-automatic, and even fully automatic variants.
      </p>
      <p>
        A shotgun is generally a smoothbore firearm, which means that the inside of the barrel is not rifled. Preceding smoothbore firearms, such as the musket,
         were widely used by armies in the 18th century. The direct ancestor to the shotgun, the blunderbuss, was also used in a similar variety of roles from
         self-defense to riot control. It was often used by cavalry troops because of its generally shorter length and ease of use, as well as by coachmen
         for its substantial power. In the 19th century, however, these weapons were largely replaced on the battlefield with breechloading rifled firearms,
         which were more accurate over longer ranges. The military value of shotguns was rediscovered in the First World War, when American forces used
         12-gauge pump action shotguns in close-quarters trench fighting to great effect. Since then, it has been used in a variety of roles in civilian,
         law enforcement, and military applications.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Most early firearms, such as the blunderbuss, arquebus, and musket had large diameter, smoothbore barrels, and could fire shot as well as
        solid balls. A firearm intended for use in wing shooting of birds was known as a fowling piece.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shot was also used in warfare; the buck and ball loading, combining a musket ball with three or six buckshot, was used throughout the history of the
        smoothbore musket. The first recorded use of the term shotgun was in 1776 in Kentucky. It was noted as part of the "frontier language of the West" by James Fenimore Cooper.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the adoption of smaller bores and rifled barrels, the shotgun began to emerge as a separate entity. Shotguns have long been the preferred
        method for sport hunting of birds, and the largest shotguns, the punt guns, were used for commercial hunting. The double-barreled shotgun has
        changed little since the development of the boxlock action in 1875. Modern innovations such as interchangeable chokes and subgauge inserts make
        the double-barreled shotgun the shotgun of choice in skeet, trap shooting, and sporting clays, as well as with many hunters.
