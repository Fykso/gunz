      <h1>Designated marksman rifle</h1>
      <p>
        A designated marksman rifle (DMR) is the weapon used by infantries in the designated marksman (DM) role. Although the "sniper" and
        the "designated marksman" are distinguished by mission and deployment role, rather than by operational range, the DM's role generally
        fills the range gap between a regular infantryman and a sniper. DMRs have been developed with this middle ground in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        DMRs, unlike sniper rifles, are almost always semi-automatic rifles (semi-automatic rifles are quicker than bolt-action sniper rifles,
        in terms of rapid fire) and typically have larger magazine capacities (10, 20, or 30 rounds depending on the firearm and operational requirements).
      </p>
      <p>
        These rifles have to be effective, in terms of accuracy and terminal ballistics, at ranges exceeding those of ordinary assault rifles and
        battle rifles, but do not require the extended range of a dedicated sniper rifle. DMRs often share some basic characteristics with sniper r
        ifles when compared to the weapons carried by others in the DM's unit. DMRs may have an attached telescopic sight, quickly deployed stabilizing
        bipod to allow optimized accuracy and low-recoil in temporarily fixed situations or an adjustable stock.The Designated Marksman's Rifle needs
        to function as part of unit (and possibly at close quarters).

        Most designated marksman rifles are based on an assault rifle that is currently issued by a nation's military, or on a battle rifle that was formerly issued.
        A battle rifle is a semi-automatic or full-automatic rifle that fires 7.62mm NATO or similar full-power rounds. Classic examples include the M14, FN FAL, AR-10 and Heckler &
        Koch G3. These rifles were largely replaced by assault rifles firing the 5.56mm NATO cartridge during the 1980s and 1990s.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some nations have also built rifles that were designed for the designated marksman from the ground up.
