      <h1>Submachine guns</h1>
      <p>
        A submachine gun (SMG) is a magazine-fed, automatic carbine designed to fire pistol cartridges. The term "submachine gun" was coined by John T.
        Thompson, the inventor of the Thompson submachine gun.
      </p>
      <p>
        The submachine gun was developed during World War I (1914–1918). At its zenith during World War II (1939–1945), millions of SMGs were made.
        After the war, new SMG designs appeared frequently. However, by the 1980s, SMG usage decreased.[2] Today, submachine guns have been largely
        replaced by assault rifles, which have a greater effective range and are capable of penetrating the helmets and body armor used by modern
        infantry. However, submachine guns are still used by military special forces and police SWAT teams for close quarters battle (CQB) because
        they are "a pistol-caliber weapon that's easy to control, and less likely to over-penetrate the target."

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        During World War I, the Austrians introduced the world's first machine pistol the Steyr Repetierpistole M1912/P16. The Germans also experimented
        machine pistols by converting pistols such as the Mauser C96 and Luger P-08 from semiautomatic to fully automatic operation and adding detachable
        stocks. Carbine-type automatic weapons firing pistol rounds were developed during the latter stages of World War I by Italy, Germany and the United
        States. Their improved firepower and portability offered an advantage in trench warfare.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1998, H&K introduced the last widely distributed SMG, the UMP "Universal Machine Pistol". The UMP is a 9mm, .40 S&W, or .45 ACP,
        closed-bolt blowback-operated SMG, based on the H&K G36 assault rifle. It features a predominantly polymer construction and was
        designed to be a lighter and cheaper alternative to the MP5. The UMP has a side-folding stock and is available with four different
        trigger group configurations. It was also designed to use a wide range of Picatinny rail mounted accessories
      </p>
      <p>
        By 2010, compact assault rifles had replaced submachine guns in most roles. Factors such as the increasing use of body armor and logistical concerns have combined to limit the appeal of submachine guns. However, SMGs are still used by police (especially SWAT teams) for dealing with heavily armed suspects and military special forces units for close quarters combat, due to their reduced size, recoil and muzzle blast. Submachine guns also lend themselves to the use of suppressors, particularly when loaded with subsonic ammunition. Variants of the Sterling and Heckler & Koch MP5 have been manufactured with integral suppressors.
