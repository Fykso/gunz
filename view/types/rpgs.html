      <h1>Rocket launcher</h1>
      <p>
        A rocket launcher is any device that launches a rocket-propelled projectile, although the term is often used in reference to
        mechanisms that are portable and capable of being operated by an individual.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Pre-war research programmes into military rocket technology by many of the major powers, led to the introduction of a number of rocket artillery systems with
        fixed or mobile launchers, often capable of firing a number of rockets in a single salvo. In the United Kingdom, solid fuel rockets were initially used in the
         anti-aircraft role; the 7-inch Unrotated Projectile was fired from single pedestal-mounted launchers on warships and a 3-inch version was used by shore based
          Z Batteries, for which multiple "projectors" were developed. Later developments of these weapons included the Land Mattress multiple launchers for surface
          -to-surface bombardment and the RP-3 air-to-ground rockets that were launched from rails fitted to fighter bomber aircraft. In Germany, the 15 cm
          Nebelwerfer 41 was an adaptation of a multiple barrelled smoke mortar for artillery rockets. The Soviet Katyusha was a self-propelled system, being
          mounted on trucks, tanks and even trains. The United States Army deployed the tank mounted T34 Calliope system late in the war.
      </p>
      <h2>Types:</h2>
      <h2>Shoulder-fired</h2>
      <p>
        The rocket launchers category includes shoulder-fired missile weapons, any weapon that fires a rocket-propelled projectile at a target yet is
        small enough to be carried by a single person and fired while held on one's shoulder. Depending on the country or region, people might use the
        terms "bazooka" or "RPG" as generalized terms to refer to such weapons, both of which are in fact specific types of rocket launchers. The bazooka
        is an American anti-tank weapon which was in service in 1942â€“1957, while the RPG is a Soviet anti-tank weapon.
      </p>
      <h2>Rocket pod</h2>
      <p>
        A rocket pod is a launcher that contains several unguided rockets held in individual tubes, designed to be used by attack aircraft or attack helicopters
        for close air support. In many cases, rocket pods are streamlined to reduce aerodynamic drag. The first pods were developed immediately after World War
         II, as an improvement over the previous arrangement of firing rockets from rails, racks or tubes fixed under the wings of aircraft. Early examples of
          pod-launched rockets were the US Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket and the French SNEB.
      </p>
      <h2>Large scale</h2>
      <p>
        Larger-scale devices which serve to launch rockets include the multiple rocket launcher, a type of unguided rocket artillery system; the
        transporter erector launcher, a vehicle with an integrated prime mover that can carry, elevate to firing position and launch one or more
        missiles and various launchers for guided missiles,
        including ones for surface-to-air missiles, anti-ship missiles, and antisubmarine warfare guided missiles (see ASROC, Sea Lance, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The largest scale rocket launcher devices currently in existence are missile launch facilities.
