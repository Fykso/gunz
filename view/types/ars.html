      <h1>Assault rifles</h1>
      <p>
        An assault rifle is a selective-fire rifle that uses an intermediate cartridge and a detachable magazine. Assault rifles were first used
        during World War II. Though Western nations were slow to accept the assault rifle concept, by the end of the 20th century they had become
        the standard weapon in most of the world's armies, replacing full-powered rifles and sub-machine guns in most roles. Examples include the StG 44, AK-47 and the M16 rifle.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term assault rifle is generally attributed to Adolf Hitler, who for propaganda purposes used the German word "Sturmgewehr" (which translates to "storm rifle"
         or "assault rifle"), as the new name for the MP43, subsequently known as the Sturmgewehr 44 or StG 44. However, other sources
         dispute that Hitler had much to do with coining the new name besides signing the production order. The StG 44 is generally considered the first
         selective fire military rifle to popularize the assault rifle concept. Today, the term assault rifle is used to define firearms sharing the same basic characteristics as the StG 44.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        The Germans were the first to pioneer the assault rifle concept, during World War II, based upon research that showed that most firefights happen
        within 400 meters and that contemporary rifles were over-powered for most small arms combat. They would soon develop a select-fire intermediate
        powered rifle combining the firepower of a submachine gun with the range and accuracy of a rifle.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result was the Sturmgewehr 44, which the Germans produced in large numbers; approximately half a million were made. It fired a new and
        revolutionary intermediate powered cartridge, the 7.92×33mm Kurz. This new cartridge was developed by shortening
        the standard 7.92×57mm Mauser round and giving it a lighter 125-grain bullet, that limited range but allowed for more controllable automatic
        fire. A smaller lighter cartridge also allowed soldiers to carry more ammunition "to support the higher consumption rate of automatic fire."
      </p>
      <p>
        Like the Germans, the Soviets were influenced by experience showing that most combat engagements occur within 400 meters and that their soldiers were consistently outgunned
         by heavily armed German troops, especially those armed with the Sturmgewehr 44 assault rifles. The Soviets soon developed the 7.62×39mm M43 cartridge, the semi-automatic SKS carbine
         and the RPD light machine gun. Shortly after World War II, the Soviets developed the AK-47 assault rifle, which would quickly replace the SKS in Soviet service.
