      <h1>Colt</h1>
      <p>
        Colt's Manufacturing Company (CMC, formerly Colt's Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company) is an American firearms manufacturer,
        founded in 1855 by Samuel Colt. It is the successor corporation to Colt's earlier firearms-making efforts, which started in 1836.
        Colt is known for the engineering, production, and marketing of firearms, most especially between the 1850s and World War I,
        when it was a dominating force in its industry and a seminal influence on manufacturing technology. Colt's earliest designs played
         a major role in the popularization of the revolver and the shift away from earlier single-shot pistols. Although Samuel Colt did
          not invent the revolver concept, his designs resulted in the first very successful ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most famous Colt products include the Colt Walker, made 1847 in the facilities of Eli Whitney Jr., the Single Action Army
        or Peacemaker, the Colt Python, and the Colt M1911 pistol, which is currently the longest-standing military and law enforcement
         service handgun in the world and is still used today. Though they did not develop it, for a long time Colt was also primarily
         responsible for all AR-15 and M16 rifle production, as well as many derivatives of those firearms. The most successful and famous
         of these are numerous M16 carbines, including the Colt Commando family, and the M4 carbine.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Samuel Colt received a British patent on his improved design for a revolver in 1835, and two U.S. patents in 1836, one on February 25
        (later numbered U.S. Patent 9430X) and another on August 29 (U.S. Patent 1,304). That same year, he founded his first corporation for its
        manufacture, the Patent Arms Manufacturing Company of Paterson, New Jersey, Colt's Patent. The first firearm manufactured at the new
        Paterson plant, however, was the Colt First Model Ring Lever rifle beginning in 1837. This was followed shortly thereafter in late 1837 by
        the introduction of the Colt Paterson. This corporation suffered quality problems in production. Making firearms with interchangeable 
        parts was still rather new (it had reached commercial viability only about a decade before), and it was not yet easy to replicate across
        different factories. Interchangeability was not complete in the Paterson works, and traditional gunsmithing techniques did not fill the gap
        entirely there. The Colt Paterson revolver found patchy success and failure; some worked well, while others had problems. The United States
        Marine Corps and United States Army reported quality problems with these earliest Colt revolvers. Production had ended at the New Jersey corporation by 1842.
