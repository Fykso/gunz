      <h1>Remington</h1>
      <p>
        Remington Arms Company, LLC is an American manufacturer of firearms and ammunition in the United States. It was founded in 1816 by Eliphalet
        Remington in Ilion, New York, as E. Remington and Sons. Remington is America's oldest gun maker and is claimed to be America's oldest factory
        that still makes its original product. Remington is the largest U.S. producer of shotguns and rifles. The company has developed or adopted
        more cartridges than any other gun maker or ammunition manufacturer in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Until 2015, Remington Arms was part of the Freedom Group, which is owned by Cerberus Capital Management. In 2014, a new plant was built
        in Huntsville, Alabama to produce AR-15 style semi-automatic rifles and Remington 1911 R1 pistols. In 2015, the Freedom Group was
        renamed as Remington Outdoor Company. Remington filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, in March 2018, having accumulated over $950 million in debt.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        The Remington company was founded in 1816. Eliphalet Remington II (1793â€“1861) believed he could build a better gun than he could buy.
        Remington began designing and building a flintlock rifle for himself. At age 23 (in late 1816), he entered a shooting match; though he
        finished second, his well-made gun impressed other contestants. Before Remington left the field that day, he had received so many orders
        from other competitors that he had officially entered the gunsmithing business. By 1828, he moved his operation to nearby Ilion. This site
        is still used by the modern Remington firearms plant.
      </p>
      <p>
        On March 7, 1888, ownership of E. Remington & Sons was sold by the Remington family to new owners, Marcellus Hartley and Partners.
        This consisted of Hartley and Graham of New York, New York, a major sporting goods chain who also owned the Union Metallic Cartridge
        Company in Bridgeport and the Winchester Repeating Arms Company of New Haven, both in Connecticut. At this time the name was formally
        changed to the Remington Arms Company. The Bridgeport site became the home of Remington's ammunition plant.
